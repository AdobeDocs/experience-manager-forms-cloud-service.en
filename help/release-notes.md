# Forms as a Cloud Service prerelease notes {#overview}

Welcome to the Forms as a Cloud Service prerelease program. Read on for resources and instructions to get started and make the best of the prerelease program.

Adobe Experience Manager Forms as a Cloud Service (FaaCS) offers a cloud-native, Platform as a service (PaaS) solution for businesses to create, manage, publish, and update complex digital forms while integrating with back-end processes, business rules, and data from within a system that is always current, always available, and always learning platform.

## Whatâ€™s supported in current pre-release build {#current-support}

The current prerelease build of Forms as a Cloud Service supports managing and publishing adaptive forms and creating Document of Record (DoR) for adaptive forms created with Automated Forms Conversion service. For the detailed list of supported features, see [Forms as a Cloud Service Overview](overview.md)

June 2020 release does not support using FaaCS environments for creating forms. You can use FaaCS environments to store, manage, and publish adaptive forms and use the local development environment to create an adaptive form. You export adaptive forms and related assets from a local development environment to FaaCS environments for publishing. For instructions to set up a local development environment, see the [Set up the environment article](tbd.md)
