# AEM Forms as a Cloud Service pre-pilot release notes {#overview}

Welcome to the AEM Forms as a Cloud Service pre-pilot program. Read on for resources and instructions to get started and make the best of the pre-pilot program.

Adobe Experience Manager AEM Forms as a Cloud Service offers a cloud-native, Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for businesses to create, manage, publish, and update complex digital forms while integrating submitted data with back-end processes, business rules, and saving data in a data store for later use. The service is always current, always available, and always learning.

When you set up and configure AEM Forms as a Cloud service environment, you set up development, staging, and production environments. You configure two types of development environments:

* **Local development environment (An AEM 6.5.5 Forms instance):** Use a [local development environment](setup-local-development-environment.md) to create forms and related assets (themes, templates, custom submit actions, and more) and convert PDF Forms to adaptive forms. After an adaptive form or related assets are ready on the local development instance, you can export the adaptive form and related assets from the local development environment to an AEM Forms as a Cloud Service environment for publishing.

* **AEM Forms as a Cloud Service development environment:** Use the [AEM Forms as a Cloud Service](setup-forms-cloud-service.md) environment to test adaptive forms and related assets before publishing the forms. Do not use AEM Forms as a Cloud Service development environment to create adaptive forms or related assets <!--, form-centric workflows, a form data model, or to generate a Document of Record. -->

 

## Whatâ€™s supported in pre-pilot release {#current-support}

* **Adaptive forms:** You can use the local development environment to create adaptive forms. The following adaptive forms features are available in pre-pilot release:

  * Create an adaptive form based on a pre-defined JSON, XML, or XSD schema to make it easier for existing systems of your organization to consume the submitted form data.
  * Use templates and themes to standardize content structure and appearance of the forms of an organization or a department.
  * Use rules created with the visual editor to add interactive behavior to adaptive forms. You can also use rules to show hide sections of a form, retrieve, and save data to a database,  and prefill an adaptive form.
  * Use prefill service to fill a form with existing customer data based on a  criterion to fasten the form filling process and reduce the abandon rate.
  * Create a custom submit action to process submitted data or perform other  actions before saving the data to a data source.
  * Group common fields into reuseable form fragments. You can reuse form  fragments to quickly build multiple forms.
  * Create repeatable sections within an adaptive form. These sections are  dynamically added to or removed from a form.
  * Use lazy loading to defer initialization or loading (lazy loading) of the sections of an adaptive form.

* **Forms management and publishing:** You can use an AEM Forms as a Cloud Service instance to store, manage, and publish an adaptive form. The following forms management and publishing features are available in pre-pilot release:
    
  * Export and import forms and related assets
  * Use groups to lists to limit access of users based on their role
  * Use folders to organize forms and related assets
  * Search forms and related assets
  * Publish adaptive forms and related assets


* **Automated conversion of PDF forms adaptive forms:** You can use the Automated Forms Conversion Service (AFCS) on a local development environment to convert PDF Forms to adaptive from. It helps you accelerate digitization and modernization of data capture experience.
