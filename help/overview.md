# Experience Manager Forms as a Cloud Service Overview {#overview}

Adobe Experience Manager Forms as a Cloud Service (FaaCS) offers a cloud-native, Platform as a service (PaaS) solution for businesses to create, manage, publish, and update complex digital forms while integrating submitted data with back-end processes, business rules, and saving data in a data store for later use. The service is always current, always available, and always learning. 

You can use the service to create interactive and engaging digital enrollment experiences complete with electronic signing, document of record, and processing the submitted data. For example, an organization We.Forms is looking to digitize their customer enrollment journey. It involves converting multiple legacy forms (PDF and Print Forms) to interactive and responsive web forms, enabling customers to electronically sign these forms, and keeping customers updated with the enrolment process with notifications. 

The organization can use FaaCS to create new forms, use Automated Forms Conversion service to automatically convert their legacy forms to adaptive forms (web forms), Adobe Sign to allow their customers to digitally sign the forms, and FaaCS workflow to process submitted data and send notifications.
