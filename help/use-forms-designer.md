# Using Designer {#install-designer}

Designer is a point-and-click graphical form design tool that simplifies the creation of XDP form templates. You can design a form template, define its logic, and meet strict legislative requirements. These templates server as a Document of Record template for an Adaptive Form. You can also [create Adaptive Forms based on these form templates](creating-adaptive-form.md#create-an-adaptive-form-based-on-xml-or-json-schema). These forms templates are different from [Adaptive Form templates](template-editor.md).
