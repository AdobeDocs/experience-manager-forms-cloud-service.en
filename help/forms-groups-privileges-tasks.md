# Groups and permissions {#aem-forms-on-osgi-groups-and-privileges}

You can [create groups](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/cloud-service/accessing/aem-users-groups-and-permissions.html#accessing) and assign policies and [users](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/cloud-service/accessing/aem-users-groups-and-permissions.html#accessing) to the groups. These policies control permissions of the users that are part of the group.
